# Out in Dixieland
MSCH-C 220 Project 03-Juicy Brick-Breaker

Out in Dixieland is a brick-breaker with a early jazz style, influenced predominantly by the blues. Difficulty increasing across the 3 levels as new bricks with increasing health, as well as increasing reward, are introduced. 
(Also sorry some of the music is really quiet and also just... bad. Theory and improv are definitely not my strong suits in music and also the files didn't transfer correctly onto my laptop from the studio computer so I had to cobble them back together lol.)

## Implementation
- Animated gold highlight every time bricks are hit
- Falling "dust" particles every time bricks are hit
- Bricks falling when destroyed
- Background music
- Sound effects on death, and collision with paddle and bricks
- Screen shake on death
- Shader background on start and end screens
- Different colors corresponding to different point values on bricks
- Certain bricks only available in certain levels, with health function introduced as well
